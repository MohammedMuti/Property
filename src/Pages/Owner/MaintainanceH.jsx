            <li>
              <span>Property management </span>
              involves the oversight, operation, and maintenance of real estate
              properties on behalf of the owner. Here are some key aspects:
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Tenant Relations: </span>
              Property managers handle all interactions with tenants, including
              leasing, rent collection, handling complaints, and arranging
              repairs or maintenance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Leasing and Vacancies: </span>
              They advertise vacancies, screen potential tenants, and execute
              leases. They also handle lease renewals and terminations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Maintenance and Repairs: </span>
              Property managers are responsible for ensuring that the property
              is well-maintained and in compliance with local regulations. This
              includes regular maintenance tasks as well as emergency repairs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Financial Management: </span>
              They collect rent, pay expenses (like maintenance, utilities, and
              taxes), and provide financial reports to the property owner.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Legal Compliance: </span>
              Property managers ensure that the property complies with all
              relevant laws and regulations, including building codes, zoning
              laws, and landlord-tenant laws.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Inspections: </span>
              Regular inspections of the property are conducted to assess its
              condition and identify any maintenance or repair needs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Evictions: </span>
              If necessary, property managers handle the eviction process in
              accordance with local laws and regulations.
            </li>
            <li>
              When choosing a property management company, it's important to
              consider their experience, reputation, fees, and the range of
              services they offer. It's also helpful to ask for references from
              other property owners they've worked with.
